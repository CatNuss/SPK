<img id="abtimg" src="img/cogs.jpg">

	<p>SPK is situated in the heart of Cape Towns' marine engineering hub, Paarden Eiland, and 15 minutes away from Cape Town International Airport. This allows us to respond quickly to our customers' needs. We deliver orders throughout the Western Cape daily, and regularly export engineering supplies and equipment to countries such as Nigeria, Mauritius, Zambia and Botswana.
	Over the past 15 years, we have evolved and expanded our product range extensively in order for us to be competitive in the market, and more importantly to allow us to supply a vast array of products to our customers. We strive to provide quality products, along with the necessary spares and back up service. Customer service and satisfaction is extremely important to us and is one of the main factors that sets us apart from our competitors. From our quick delivery service to non-standard products that need to be imported, we will do everything within our ability to satisfy our customers' needs.
